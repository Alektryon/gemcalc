# Gematria Calculator

Web app that calculates the value of a word and returns words that share the same value.

## Stack

TypeScript, Next.js 13, CSS.

Deployed on Vercel.

## Ciphers

The app uses various traditional and non-traditional ciphers:

Standard / Reverse Standard

Pythagorean (aka Reduction) / Reverse Pythagorean

Simple (aka Ordinal)

Multiple 6 (often called Base 6 Gematria online, renamed here so as not to be confused with base number systems)

Ciphers are created from alphabet classes that assign A - Z values according to specific patterns.

For example, the Pythagorean cipher is created by passing `9` as a modulus into the `ModularAlphabet` constructor, making a pattern wrapping from 1 - 9 and ending at 8 on Z.

The Standard cipher increments from A - Z in steps of 1 - 9, 10 - 90, 100 - 800. This is created by passing `[1, 10, 100]` as an argument to the `IncrementalAlphabet` constructor, where each element is the amount by which to increment and the number of elements determines the length of each step. `[30, 60, 30, 90]` would produce a cipher incrementing from A - Z in steps of 30 - 210, 60 - 420, 30 - 210, 90 - 450. Negative increments can also be used.

This means any number of custom ciphers can be made using these patterns (even though they have no basis in historical exegesis).
